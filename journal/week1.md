# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework
### Containerize Application
* I Created a Dockerfile within the *flask-backend* and *frontend-react-js* folders containing the image instructions.  
[Backend Dockerfile](https://github.com/MahmoudGooda/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/Dockerfile "Backend Dockerfile") - [Frontend Dockerfile](https://github.com/MahmoudGooda/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/frontend-react-js/Dockerfile "Frontend Dockerfile")
* To be able to run all containers in a single command, I created the *docker-compose.yml* file in the root folder then copied the contents from project repo.
[docker-compose file](https://github.com/MahmoudGooda/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/docker-compose.yml "docker-compose file")
* Now compose up to run the containers (building the specific images if needed) and wait until all containers are in *started* state.

### Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document
Following along with the *Create the notification feature* video:
* In the *openapi-3.0.yml* file, I added a new path *"/api/activities/notifications:"*, description, tags, and response details.

### Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications  
* I created notifications endpoint, created a python file for notifications activities within *backend_flask* folder.
I copied the *home activities* contents, then made some edits to be for notifications activites.

### Write a React Page for Notifications
* I created a js file for the notifications page (same as homefeed page with some modifications) and a .css file for styling if needed.

Finally we can get the notifications page same as expected!

### Run DynamoDB Local Container and ensure it works
* After adding DynamoDB Local and Postgres to that *Docker-compose.yml* file.
I ran some commands to ensure it works ( same from *100DaysOfCloud* repo).
